# Rafx

[**Documentation**](docs/index.md)

Rafx is a multi-backend renderer that prioritizes performance, flexibility, and productivity. It optionally integrates 
with the [`distill`](https://github.com/amethyst/distill) asset pipeline to provide workflows and tools suitable
for real-world projects with multidisciplinary teams.

This crate contains several layers:
 * `rafx-api`: Low-level graphics API abstraction 
 * `rafx-visibility`: Low-level retained API for visibility determination
 * `rafx-framework`: Mid-level framework that eases resource management, lifetime handling, and draw call dispatching
 * `rafx-assets`: Asset layer that integrates with [`distill`](https://github.com/amethyst/distill)
 * `rafx-renderer`: A pipelined renderer with a plugin system for customizing it
   
Rafx also provides tools for building shaders and packing assets.

### Current Support:

Rafx supports most mainstream platforms. Proprietary platforms can be supported by adding an additional backend.

| Platform | Vulkan   | Metal | GL ES 2.0 (4) |
| -------- | -------- | ----- | ------------- |
| Windows  |   âœ…     |       |      âœ…       |
| macOS    |   âœ…     |  âœ…   |      âœ…       |
| Linux    |   ðŸŸ¨ (1) |       |      ðŸŸ¨ (1)   |
| iOS      |   âœ…     |  âœ…   |      ðŸŸ¥ (3)   |
| Android  |   ðŸŸ¨ (2) |       |      ðŸŸ¥ (3)   |
| WebGL    |          |       |      âœ…       |

**Caveats**: 
 1. Linux reported working but not regularly tested. Some driver/window manager combinations might not work, especially
    with vulkan.
 2. Android might work with vulkan but has not been tested. (It likely can be made to work) 
 3. Mobile OpenGL devices might work but may need improvements to create the initial OpenGL graphics context.
 4. Limitations in the OpenGL ES 2.0 API prevent full implementation. The main demo does not work in 
GL ES 2.0.

Please keep in mind, this crate is still in pre-0.1.0 status!

## Roadmap

 * The API of `rafx-api` is unlikely to change significantly
 * Other higher level crates are being refactored/improved based on demo improvements and dogfooding in
   other projects
 * For the near-term future, the focus will be on:
     * Improvements to the framework (visibility, multithreading, API ergonomics)
     * Exploring options that would allow adding rendering features in a modular way, letting end-users
       more easily share their work.
     * Maturing the existing backends and adding new backends
     * Extending the demo with more rendering techniques
   
**This crate will use semantic versioning rules after 0.1.0 of this project has been published. The
0.0.x versions do not follow semantic versioning rules.**

## Safety

Rafx is unsafe because hardware-accelerated rendering is fundamentally unsafe. However, we reserve usage
of the unsafe keyword for when an operation can produce undefined behavior for reasons other than interacting
with the GPU. Please see these documents for more detail:

 * https://github.com/aclysma/rafx/blob/master/docs/api/api_design.md#safety
 * https://github.com/aclysma/rafx/blob/master/docs/api/safety.md

## Prerequisites

CMake must be available on your path. It is used by SDL2 in the demo and by upstream crates used within the shader
pipeline.

## Running the Demo

The demo should be run from the root of the repository. These commands should clone the repo
and run the demo.

```
git clone https://github.com/aclysma/rafx.git
cd rafx
cd demo
cargo run --bin demo --release --features "[BACKEND_FEATURE]"
```

BACKEND_FEATURE should either be "rafx-vulkan" or "rafx-metal"

Running in release reduces logging and disables GPU validation. The first time it will load more slowly because it
has to import the assets, including a GLTF mesh with large textures. **Using profile overrides to optimize upstream crates
is highly recommeneded. Asset processing is extremely slow in debug mode.** (i.e. 30s instead of 2s)

The demo uses SDL2 and in debug mode, vulkan validation. If you have trouble running the demo, please check that
dependencies for both SDL2 and vulkan are available.

### Demo Features

* Render thread decoupled from main thread [(diagram)](docs/images/pipelining.png)
* Shader build pipeline [(diagram)](docs/images/shader_processor.png)
* Offline texture compression and mipmap generations (via 
  [basis-universal](https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal) format)
* Asynchronous asset loading
* Assets can be streamed to remote hardware (i.e. a phone)
* OR assets can be cooked into a binary blob for shipping
* Hot-reloading assets (needs more work, some asset types do not work reliably)
* Render graph can be used for efficient and flexible definition of a render pipeline, including rendering to textures
  and multiple cameras.
* Auto-generated shader bindings make working with descriptor sets convenient and less error prone.
* Material System supporting multiple passes
* Multi-camera support (to produce shadow maps, for example)
* Demo game state stored in ECS (NOTE: demo uses legion but the renderer is ECS-agnostic)
* PBR Meshes
* Sprites
* Debug Draw
* imgui
* HDR Pipeline with Bloom
* Point, Spot, and Directional Lights
* Multiple Spot/Directional/Point light soft shadows
* Font Rendering
* LDTK tilemap import
* Frustum culling for multiple cameras in 2D or 3D, in both orthogonal or perspective projections

## Tools

The renderer includes a few tools for processing shaders and packing data in a binary blob.

### Shader Processor

This tool parses GLSL and produces matching rust code. This makes working with descriptor sets easier and safer!
 * The tool is located at [/shader-processor](rafx-shader-processor)
 * The demo includes a `shaders` crate to compile the generated rust code. It's located at [/demo/shaders](demo/shaders).
   Just the rust code is auto-generated, not the Cargo.toml.
 * The easiest way to "refresh shaders" in the demo is to hit compile.bat or compile.sh in that folder
 * You can `cargo install rafx-shader-processor`. Be sure to install the same version as you include in your project.
   Also, don't forget to update it if you update your project's dependencies!

![Diagram illustrating that shaders are processed into .metal, .spirv, etc.](docs/images/shader_processor.png)

The shader processor produces the following assets artifacts

* API-specific such as compiled SPIR-V or metal source code
* Metadata used by rafx at runtime
* Rust code that makes working with the shader easier
* Intermediate formats for debugging/inspection

The shader package can be loaded as an asset and contains everything needed to load a compiled shader.
 
### Packaging Assets

This tool currently is only useful for packing assets.
 * Pack files like this: `run --package cli -- --pack out.pack`
 * Run the demo like this: `run --package demo -- --packfile out.pack`
 * You'll likely want to create a binary from your own main.rs for this tool. That way you can add your own resource
   types.

## Features

 * `rafx-vulkan`: Use the vulkan backend
 * `rafx-metal`: Use the metal backend
 * `framework`: Include and re-export rafx-framework from the rafx crate
 * `assets`: Include and re-export rafx-assets from the rafx crate
 * `renderer`: Include and re-export rafx-renderer from the rafx crate

## Crates

 * `rafx-base` - Shared helpers/data structures. Nothing exciting
 * `rafx-api` - Rendering API abstraction layer.
   * Vulkan backend for windows/linux
   * Metal backend for macOS/iOS
 * `rafx-visibility` - Retained visibility API.
   * Simple handle-based abstraction.
   * Fast, thread-safe visibility queries.
 * `rafx-framework` - Resource management for images, buffers, descriptor sets, etc.
   * Most things are hashed and reference counted
   * Provides a render graph
   * Nearly all assets are data-driven from serializable and hashable structures rather than hard-coded.
   * Buffers and images are asynchronously uploaded on dedicated transfer queue when available
   * Multi-pass material abstraction with bindable parameters
   * Nodes/Render Jobs system - Inspired by the 2015 GDC talk "Destiny's Multithreaded Rendering Architecture."
      * A job system with extract, prepare, and write phases
      * Rendering is pipelined with simulation thread, and the job structure is intended to be highly parallel (not
        actually executed parallel yet)
      * Handles multiple views and phases allowing advanced features like shadow mapping
      * Flexible sorting mechanism for interleaving and batching write commands from multiple rendering features
   * Visibility Region - Built on top of `rafx-visibility`
      * Higher-level visibility API, integrated with framework render jobs
 * `rafx-assets` - An asset loading and management system.
   * Assets can hot reload from files (but see [#14](rafx/issues/14))
   * Because distill pre-processes and stores cached assets as they change, custom processing/packing can be
     implemented while maintaining extremely fast load times. For example, texture compression could be implemented
     as an import step.  
   * Separate multi-thread friendly path for creating assets at runtime
 * `rafx-renderer` - A pipelined renderer with a plugin system for customizing it

## FAQ

**Q: Why am I getting mysterious panics from a bincode serializer**

A: Assets are imported and serialized via serde to bincode. If any of these structs are modified, the asset needs to be
reimported. The "proper" fix is to bump the importer's version, which will force re-importing affected assets. However,
deleting .assets_db is an easy fix. In general to avoid this, we should not commit modifications to these structs
without also bumping the importer version numbers.
